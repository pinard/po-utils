A new pretest for the PO utilities is now available as:

Please report problems to <po-utils-bugs@iro.umontreal.ca>, or directly to
me at to <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>.

For PO mode, I split portability matters in two, so it _both_ compile
without warnings (on Emacs 20.4 at least), and run correctly :-).

`xpot' has been changed to read references from PO files, instead of
referencing the PO file itself.  References are also properly refilled
on output.  Still to be done: transmitting flags from read PO files.

I changed `xpot' to generate references more compactly, avoiding the
repetition of the file name when superfluous.  PO mode has been changed
accordingly to imply the file name as needed.
