	* Makefile.am: Take care of installing po-mode.el.
	* elisp-comp: New file, from elsewhere.

	before portability matters and add some variable declarations.

	* scanner.l (STATE_PYTHON): Include opening parenthesis in
	identifier, instead of using slower right context.

	then simplify many calls.

	introduced by a starter token, was causing a parse error.
	Reported by Bernhard Herzog.

	(po-mode-destroy-cleanup): Check if buffer has a
	name, so one does not attempt destroying an already killed buffer.
	(po-check-lock): Check if a buffer has a name instead of using
	bufferp, because killed buffers are still buffers.
